# README


Things you may want to cover:

* Ruby version  
Created with ruby version `2.7.1p83` 

* System dependencies

* Configuration  

* Database creation  
To make changes to the database do not make changes directly to the `schema.rb` file, run the command 
`rails g migration "short_migration_identifier"` and make descriptions of the changes you want to make to the table
look to the existing migrations for reference. Once you have written your migrations, run the command `rake db:migrate`
and you will see the schema.rb file update to reflect your changes.

* How to run the test suite
